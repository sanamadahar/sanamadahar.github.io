        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! I’m Sana Madahar, and I’m currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Psychology with a strong interest in Industrial and Organizational (I/O) Psychology. I’ve always been fascinated by how people work together, what motivates them, how teams communicate, and how organizations can create environments that bring out everyone’s best. My goal is to build a career that blends research, psychology, and workplace development to help people thrive both personally and professionally.
Before coming to UCR, I was deeply involved in peer counseling at Los Osos High School. That experience was where I first saw the power of communication and empathy in real time. I facilitated peer support sessions, helped students navigate conflicts, and worked to create inclusive spaces where everyone felt heard. Those moments taught me the importance of trust and psychological safety, things that are just as essential in classrooms as they are in organizations.
In the summer of 2024, I worked as a Data Analyst at Shivnet Technologies, where I collected and analyzed market data on computer components. It might sound far from psychology, but that experience actually deepened my interest in research and data-driven decision-making. I learned how to look for patterns, connect variables, and interpret what the numbers were really saying, all skills that apply directly to research in psychology and understanding human behavior in organizations.
At UCR, I’ve started building a strong foundation in research and statistics through courses like Introduction to Psychology and Psychological Methods. I love the challenge of turning data into insights, and I’m excited to keep developing those skills as I move through my degree. My GPA is currently 3.59, and I take pride in staying disciplined and curious about the topics that interest me most, motivation, teamwork, and leadership.
Beyond academics, I’ve always tried to stay involved in meaningful extracurriculars. I served as the Communications Chair for No Place for Hate, a student organization focused on promoting inclusion and respect. In that role, I helped coordinate meetings, track attendance, and lead initiatives that built community and awareness. I also co-led presentations for the Everyone Matters Conference, where my team focused on active listening and communication, two areas that continue to shape how I approach collaboration and group dynamics.
I’m fluent in English and have a comprehensive understanding of Hindi, which helps me connect with people from different backgrounds and perspectives. I’ve also earned an Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) certificate, which has given me valuable tools in understanding empathy, crisis response, and emotional well-being.
Overall, I’d describe myself as adaptable, analytical, and genuinely passionate about understanding people. I’m eager to gain more hands-on experience in research or applied psychology settings, and I’m always looking for ways to learn from others while contributing my own perspective. Industrial and Organizational Psychology feels like the perfect fit for me, it’s where human connection meets evidence-based problem-solving, and that’s exactly where I want to be.
